## Kamala Harrison Ford :7

**Hello there people !
On today's epsiode of : How did the united states of america fuck up again ? Donald Trump was elected ! How could this happen ? Well we'll see this in details soon enough !
Firstly, we're here with a fan of this so called real life Iron Man, can you explain to us what you like about him ? His attitude ? His jokes ? His confidence ?**

*Well of couse we like everything about him ! Our Donald Trump really is a real life hero for the peoples of America, he cares about getting the united states away from the inflation and everything, he wants to end wars, why can you not like him ?*

**I'd have a thing or two to say about that... Anyway, next question, did the last time he was elected convince you that you can trust him ? For exemple do you not remember his gestion of the pandemic that caused over 350 thousands death in the us in 2020 ?**

*Donald Trump isn't responsible for any of that ! Remember the covid came from China ins't that right ? He was a really good president last time, this years were the best of my life ! Look at what happened since we got away from him and elected that old men Joe ? Was it really worth it to get away from our hero ?*

**Of course of course... Let's now switch teams should we ? We've now got a friend that voted for Kamala Harris, same question, what do you like about her ?**

 *Of couse i can, Kamala was a candidate we could trust, she wanted to take back america into the right path, she wanted to fight climate change, to give women the rights they deserves on their bodies. Moreover, she said she would work full time on ending the war in palestine, unlike a certain candidate that would probably go to work with a wanted list of people that hasn't voted for him.*

**Well now i'm okay with that answer ! Do you think she'll be able to be elected next time ? If so will you vote for her again or will you consider changing teams and vote another candidate ? And if she doesn't participate in the election next time, will you even go and vote for someone ?**

*Hell yeah, i'll go and vote for my convictions anyway, even if Kamala isn't there anymore, but i believe next time she'll participate again, and she'll win !*

**Thank you both for the interview ! And now have a great day and see you next time in another episode of : "How did the united states of america fuck up again ?" !**
