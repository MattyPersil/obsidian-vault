## Compte rendu
### Français
La vidéo met en évidence les différents impacts des régimes alimentaires de mauvaise qualité au Royaume-Uni. Ces problématiques coûtent plus de 6 milliards à la NHS chaque année, et on demande au gouvernement d'améliorer les standards nutritionnels pour éviter des conséquences graves pour la santé publique et la planète. La hausse de l’obésité contribue directement à l’augmentation des émissions de carbone, aggravant la crise climatique. Les maladies liées à l'obésité coûtent environ 500 millions £ chaque année au système de santé. La hausse des déplacements alimente la demande en carburant, augmentant les émissions et les coûts des billets. Les efforts actuels sont jugés insuffisants pour répondre aux enjeux liés à la santé et à l’environnement. On voit donc un fardeau économique pour la NHS, il y a urgence pour réduire la pression financière sur celle ci, ces régimes alimentaires nuisent aussi à la santé des citoyens et à l'environnement, on retrouve l'idée d'une communication axée sur l'alimentation équilibrée, et donner des habitudes à long termes plutôt que des régimes à cours terme.

### English
This video puts in evidence the different impacts of the poor quality diets in the United Kingdom. These problematics costs more that 6 billion pounds to the NHS each years, and we ask the government to raise the nutritionnal stands to dodge the serious consequences for the public health and the planet. The raise of obesity directly contribute to the augmentation of CO2 emmisions, aggravating the climate crisis. The diseases linked to obesity corsts around 500 million pounds each year to the health system. The increase of travels raise the fuel demand, and raise the CO2 emissions and ticket costs. Actuel efforts are judged insufficient to answer the challenges linked to health and envrionnement. We see an economic burden for the NHS, there is a need to reduce financiel pressure on it, these diets also harm peoples health and harm the environnement, we come to the idea of a communication focused on balanced diet, and give people long terms habitutes rather than short term diets.



# Test
This video has a very interesting content about difference between a good oral presentation and a bad one, it starts by a student talking in front of his class, only reading his paper and not looking to the audience he has, he wasn't smiling or talking really loud for everyone to hear, his phone even ringed in the middle of the presentation that was about the start of the american revolution, to summarize it, this was a very bad presentation. After a few tips from other students and his teacher, the next week, that is the second part of the video, he come back to do a new one. For this second presentation he was a lot more prepared, his phone didn't ring in the middle of it, he was looking at the audience, smiling, speaking clearly for everyone, and used an anecdote to keep the audience attention and help them connect with him. To put it simply, it was a clearly better presentation, that was about stress and how important it is to be able to recognize it.
